Conversations are built on a webpage where developers design dialogue structures, which are then saved as JSON files in the serverâ€™s plugin folder. The Command Interface allows further management of conversations, including adding/removing players and adjusting flow in real-time. This plugin offers the ability to create stories, quests and simple cutscenes.</p>
